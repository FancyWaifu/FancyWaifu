Hi, Iâ€™m @FancyWaifu

I am a rising ethical hacker and pen tester. I am pretty lazy when it come's to hacking into a system, so I try to automate it the process.
The programs you see on my github are programs that I made to making hacking or pen testing a little easier!

My email is fancywaifu@gmail.com

If you have any questions or concerns about my code or programs, let me know! I really want to learn and grow!
